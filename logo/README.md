# Logo

The project's only copy of the logo, shared the same way `docs/screenshots/` is:
the landing page, the documentation site and the app all reference these files
rather than keeping their own.

## The mark

Two schedule grid lines crossing, with the one slot everybody converged on
filled in — the board, and the focal point the name refers to.

## Files

| File                   | Use                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `logo.svg`             | The default: mark plus wordmark, on light backgrounds        |
| `logo-reversed.svg`    | The same, on dark backgrounds                                |
| `logo-mono.svg`        | Single ink, for print or anywhere colour is a problem        |
| `logo-stacked.svg`     | Mark above the wordmark, for narrow or square space          |
| `icon.svg`             | The mark alone, at 32px and up                               |
| `icon-reversed.svg`    | The mark alone, on dark backgrounds                          |
| `icon-mono.svg`        | The mark alone, single ink                                   |
| `wordmark.svg`         | The name alone                                               |
| `favicon.svg`          | A heavier cut of the mark, for 16–48px only, dark-mode aware |
| `apple-touch-icon.png` | 180×180, white background (iOS renders alpha as black)       |

## The two cuts

`icon.svg` is drawn with a 5.5-unit stroke, which matches the stem weight of
Montserrat Bold beside it in the lockup. That stroke turns to grey mush below
about 32px, so `favicon.svg` redraws the same mark at 8 units on coordinates
that land on whole pixels at 16px. **Use `favicon.svg` for browser chrome and
`icon.svg` everywhere else.**

## Dark mode

`favicon.svg` carries its own `prefers-color-scheme: dark` rule, turning the ink
grid white the way `icon-reversed.svg` does — a tab strip is dark in dark mode
and the ink mark vanishes into it. The other files have separate reversed cuts
instead, because the background they sit on is the page's, not the browser's.

`public/favicon.ico` can't do this (ICO has no media queries), so it stays the
light cut for browsers with no SVG icon support.

## Colours

| Role  | Hex       |
| ----- | --------- |
| Ink   | `#1a1a1a` |
| Coral | `#e05a5a` |

Unchanged from the landing page, which already used them.

## Type

The wordmark is Montserrat Bold — the font the app loads — converted to
outlines, so nothing here needs a webfont. Retype it only by setting Montserrat
Bold at `letter-spacing: -3` per 120px and converting to paths again; do not
substitute another font.

## Derived files

`public/` needs real files for Next.js to serve, so three are copies rather
than references. Regenerate them after any change to the mark:

```sh
for s in 16 32 48; do inkscape docs/logo/favicon.svg -o "/tmp/ico-$s.png" -w $s -h $s; done
convert -background none /tmp/ico-16.png /tmp/ico-32.png /tmp/ico-48.png public/favicon.ico
cp docs/logo/favicon.svg public/icon.svg
inkscape docs/logo/icon.svg -o /tmp/at.png -w 148 -h 148
convert -size 180x180 xc:white /tmp/at.png -gravity center -composite public/apple-touch-icon.png
cp public/apple-touch-icon.png docs/logo/apple-touch-icon.png
```

The PWA icons in `public/` (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` and
`icon-maskable-512.png`) come from the same mark, but a launcher crops whatever
shape it likes out of the maskable one — so that cut is drawn smaller, well
inside the safe area. A script rather than a one-liner, since that inset is the
whole point:

```sh
bun scripts/pwa-icons.ts
```

## Usage

- Keep clear space around the logo of at least the height of the coral cell.
- Don't recolour, stretch, rotate, outline or add effects to it.
- Don't rebuild the lockup by placing `icon.svg` next to live text — the
  spacing and the cap-height alignment are baked into `logo.svg`.
- Below 32px use `favicon.svg`; the mark alone, never the lockup.
